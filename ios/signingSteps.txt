Hosting apple-app-site-association file :
--
App ID (kinda like sha256)
~Apple formats the app ID as <team id>.<bundle id>.
    ~Locate the bundle ID in the Xcode project.
    ~Locate the team ID in the developer account.
~For example: Given a team ID of S8QB4VV633 and a bundle ID of com.example.deeplinkCookbook, The app ID is S8QB4VV633.com.example.deeplinkCookbook.
--
apple-app-site-association
the hosted file would be at  <web domain>/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
The hosted file should have the following content:
--json file--
{
  "applinks": {
      "apps": [],
      "details": [
      {
        "appID": "S8QB4VV633.com.example.deeplinkCookbook",--<team id>.<bundle id>.--
        "paths": ["*"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
--json file end--
Note: It might take up to 24 hours before Apple’s Content Delivery Network (CDN) requests the apple-app-site-association (AASA) file from your web domain.
The universal link won’t work until the CDN requests the file. To bypass Apple’s CDN, check out the alternate mode section.
